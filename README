README for follow
*****************

follow is a quite simple program using inotify for following a file, e.g. a logfile in which a server writes.
It has the same effect like `tail -f` on a file, but it echoes the whole file before starting to follow, and it's very small.

COMPILING
*********

        $ gcc -o follow follow.c

INSTALLING
**********

        # cp follow /usr/bin
