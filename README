README for follow
*****************

follow is a quite simple program using inotify for following a file, e.g. a logfile in which a server writes.
It has the same effect like `tail -f` on a file, but it echoes the whole file before starting to follow, and it's very small.

It was originally written as "glue" between the file-oriented IRC client ii and a perl script so you could follow the chat in the perl script
by opening a pipe like this:

        open(CHAT,"follow out|");

By reading and writing raw bytes, it may be used with any encoding.
